My research focuses on system security and privacy, with particular emphasis on IoT ecosystems, access control, and networked systems. I also develop ML/NLP-based techniques to analyze protocols and large-scale network behavior.

## Research in Progress
- **DocuScope:** Documentation-driven protocol security analysis via loose-end mining and agentic LLMs (targeting CCS 2026).
- **Residential proxy analysis:** Understanding and detecting network traffic of residential proxies (arXiv 2024).

## Selected Topics
- IoT device management and access delegation risks
- Messaging protocol security in IoT clouds
- Privacy protection and runtime enforcement in voice assistant skills
