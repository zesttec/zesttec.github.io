I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington, focused on system security and privacy with a minor in applied machine learning. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in systems programming and security, and my research examines security risks in IoT and networked systems, as well as ML-assisted protocol analysis.

## Research Interests
- Systems security and privacy
- IoT security and access delegation
- Network measurement and proxy detection
- Security analysis with ML/NLP

## Teaching Highlights
- Instructor of record for CSCI-C 291 / INFO-E 111 (System Programming with C and Unix)
- Instructor of record for CSCI-B 430 / INFO-I 430 (Security for Networked Systems)
- Assistant instructor for graduate and upper-division security courses
